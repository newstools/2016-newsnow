Former Mamelodi Sundowns and Kaizer Chiefs development player, Tshowana Mokonyana, has passed away. Since leaving Chiefs, the midfielder-cum-striker has been on the books of Vasco da Gama and Milano United respectively in the NFD in recent seasons. Dida , as the player is known in football circles, was recently on trial with the University of Pretoria, as he had been in search of a club for the 2016/17 season.The Siya crew learnt that the player was involved in a car accident in Tshwane, which unfortunately took away his life. He was 24 years old at the time of his passing. Tshidiso Moloi, who was with Mokonyana before the accident, confirmed the unfortunate incident took place in the early hours of Tuesday.&#8220;I was with the guys and everything was fine until we went to sleep last night. When I woke up at night to go to the toilet I noticed that my brother&#8217;s car keys were missing from where they were. I noticed that &#8216;Dida&#8217; and Kia (the other friend) and two girls that we were with were also no longer in the house. I looked through the window and saw that the car wasn&#8217;t where it was parked. I received a phone call from my brother telling me that he had been called from the car insurance company to tell him that the car was involved in an accident. My brother called me again and told me that &#8216;Dida&#8217; is no more. It&#8217;s sad because it&#8217;s the same guy I was with and we were all fine,&#8221; said Moloi. Rest In Peace Tshowana Mokonyana.Source: SoccerLaduma
